// Data Modelling Concept
// Data Modelling is done to model the application data via schema
// i.e schema is the model or defines the model i.e how the data is being modelled.
// All in all defining schema is doing data modelling or giving data a model

// In Relational Schema - Modeling the data is done independent of queries i.e data model is independent of queries
// In Mongo - What is used together is stored together

// In Relational Schema - we define the schema first and then develop the application and queries
// In Mongo - We identify the queries first according to our application and then define the schema

// In Relational Schema - only one solution is possible i.e with 3rd normal form mostly
// In Mongo - many solutions are possible for modelling in a application

// Questions to ask when modelling data or doing data modelling
// 1.What are predefined data set or what kind of data is in hand?
// 2.Always consider data modelling according to unique needs ofyour application
// 3.How you will use these data or where will you need these data
// 4.How the data will be Queried
// 5.How many queries will be fired
// 6.How much filter is there per Query
// 7.How often you change and access the data.

// Phases or Methodology in doing Data Modelling
// Which involves-
// 1.Describing the Workload
        // Knowing and describing the size of data
        // Knowing the operations that needs to be performed
            // Quantifying those operations
            // Qualifying various operations(critical or non-critical)

        //Output -> 1. Data Sizing
        //          2. Various operations that will be performed
        //          3. Assumptions made on quantifying operations and size   
        //          4. Various Queries that can be made

// 2. Identify Relationships and Model them
        // Identify various Relationships that exist among the data
        // Quantify the no of those relationships
        // And then decide whether to
            // 1.Embed
            // 2.Link or Reference
            
        // Output -> 1. Various Collecions
        //           2. Shape and Structure for their model
        //           3. Fields    

// 3. Apply Patterns 
        // Recognize and Apply the required pattern
