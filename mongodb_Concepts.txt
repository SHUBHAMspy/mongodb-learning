// ObjectId Concepts

// Mongoose is an abstraction over mongoDb driver -> which actually generates almost unique object identifier 
// ObjectId is nothing but an unique identifier given to an document object.
// So when we create a new object or Document mongoose behind the scenes talks to mongoDb driver to generate new Id.
// i.e mongoDb do not generate these ObjectIds andso that we don't have to wait for mongoDb to generate them
// which makes it fast and highly scalable.

//  ObjectId is of 24 characters and every 2 character represents a byte
//  And Mongoose with the help of driver uses 12 bytes to generate this ObjectId.

// _id : 6144f7dd0aef402440ea18bb
          (24 characters)

        // 12 bytes
           // 4 bytes: timestamp
           // 3 bytes: machine identifier
           // 2 bytes: process identifier
           // 3 bytes: counter

        // 1 byte = 8 bits
        // So in 1byte we can store 2^8 = 256 Different nos
        // So in 3 bytes counter can store upto 2^24 = 16M nos thats very large(thats the range of uniqueness)
        // So in order to produce a counter with duplicate count we have to ovrflow this no of documents at a time. 
        // Which makes it very unique and almost unattainable.
